# Maleria-Detection-CNN

Malaria continues to be a significant global health challenge, particularly in regions with limited access to healthcare resources. This repository presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approach for malaria detection using publicly available datasets. The CNN model is trained on a large collection of blood smear images, where each image is labeled as either infected or uninfected. Leveraging the power of deep learning, our model learns to accurately classify images and distinguish between healthy and malaria-infected cells.

 ## Installation Guide: 
 - TensorFlow and Keras
 - OS to load files
 - Matplotlib : for ploting the diagrams
 - Numpy : Converting all pixel Values into array formate
 - CNN : Apply Convolution Neural Network and Pooling technic to reduce feature for reduce the complexity
 - Apply ANN

## Dataset: Provide the some images which are effected and not effected and also provide the link of whole dataset for training and testing of ANN

## Model Architecture: 
- CNN : Apply Convolution Neural Network For the Reducing the dimentions of the particular image
- Pooling : Pooling helps to organise the new dimention into the format which is suitable for ANN model
- layers : In this project built 3 layers of CNN to make our model to more accurate.

## Results : After traing and testing of the dataset We got the 95% accuracy but we can increase the accuracy by increasing the layers also.
